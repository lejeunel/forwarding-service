* Resilient data forwarding for AWS S3

** Introduction

This small app aims to allow robust and resilient data transfer to cloud storage.
As of today, we support local file-system as source, and S3 bucket as destination.

This is useful when working with large volumes of data, since we 
internally stores all data transactions in a SQLite database to allow resuming.

** Installation
#+begin_src sh
poetry install
#+end_src


** Configuration

See [[file:app/config.py][config.py]] to setup authentication methods and parallelism.

** Usage

#+begin_src sh
flask --help
#+end_src
